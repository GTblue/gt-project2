  ## Description
  As a result of festivals being canceled and museums closed, artists are in fact starving for exposure. Likewise, people are left without a place to find new pieces of art to enjoy. They would like to continue their support for the artistic community.

We would like to introduce Creative Meet to resolve both the needs of the artists and those who appreciate their craft. This is a platform that lets artists sign up and release their pieces for users to enjoy.
